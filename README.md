# Particle Sandbox

An advanced interactive particle physics sandbox built with HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. Create, manipulate, and experiment with thousands of particles in real-time.

## Features

### Spawn Modes
- Click & Drag: Spawn particles by clicking and dragging
- Auto Spawn: Automatically generates particles
- Explosion: Radial burst pattern
- Fountain: Upward particle stream
- Spiral: Spiral formation
- Rain: Falling particles

### Particle Shapes
- Circle
- Square
- Triangle
- Star
- Line

### Physics
- Gravity control
- Friction adjustment
- Wind forces (X and Y axis)
- Particle interactions
- Collision detection with bounce
- Mouse force interaction

### Field Forces
- Magnetic Field: Attracts particles to center
- Vortex: Creates swirling motion
- Noise: Random perturbation
- Flocking: Boid-like swarm behavior

### Visual Effects
- Particle trails with configurable length and opacity
- Connection lines between nearby particles
- Size variation
- Particle aging (size and color over lifetime)
- Blend modes (Normal, Screen, Multiply, Overlay, Lighten, Darken)
- Velocity visualization

### Color Modes
- Single color
- Random colors
- Gradient (HSL)
- Rainbow
- Age-based colors
- Velocity-based colors
- Custom color picker

### Advanced Features
- Emitter system (Mouse, Center, Random positions)
- Save/Load configurations (JSON)
- Export images (PNG)
- Performance controls (max particles: 100-50,000)
- Real-time FPS counter

### Presets
- Fireworks: Explosive particle effects
- Galaxy: Spiral galaxy formation
- Snow: Falling snow particles
- Plasma: Colorful plasma effects
- Vortex: Swirling vortex pattern
- Flocking: Swarm behavior simulation
- Magnetic: Magnetic field effects
- Chaos: High-energy chaotic system

## Usage

1. Open `particle-sandbox.html` in a modern web browser
2. Use the control panel on the left to adjust settings
3. Click and drag to spawn particles
4. Right-click to repel particles
5. Middle-click to attract particles
6. Try different presets for quick setups
7. Save your favorite configurations

## Controls

- Left Click: Spawn particles
- Drag: Create particle trails
- Right Click: Repel particles
- Middle Click: Attract particles

## Browser Compatibility

Works in all modern browsers that support HTML5 Canvas:
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

## Performance

The sandbox is optimized to handle thousands of particles while maintaining smooth frame rates. Adjust the "Max Particles" setting to balance visual complexity with performance on your system.
